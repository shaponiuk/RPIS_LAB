These formulas describe a discrete distribution because Sum on all ks P(X = k) is equal to 1.

X doesn't have a mean because we can have indefinite value with certain with certain summing orders in equation Sigma(i, i * P(X = i)).

The median method works better because it clearly indicates the center of the of the distribution (the biggest number of values is where the peak of the plot is).
